# Algorithm

- check if neural network has to be used in first iteration of self play or not because it is stupid (random)


# Unit Tests

- test MCTS
- test game logic
- test AlphaZero

# Improvements

- evaluation also parallel
- store replay buffer with less memory
- profile and try to improve run time
- parallelize logging
- maybe different library than pathos
- other NeuralNetwork (does not have to be torch)
